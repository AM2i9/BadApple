So I got bored today, and decided to make Bad Apple in Windows File Manager.

Disclaimer: I DO NOT OWN A PART OF THIS CODE

The section of code in img.py that converts the frames to ASCII is NOT mine, and can be found at https://gist.github.com/A2x2/b1b27b15b0590d36351b9b19ce25a04e

The video and song Bad Apple is also not mine, and can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8
